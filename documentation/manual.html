<h1>Coffeemaker.io</h1>

<h2>Your personal platform kit</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Coffeemaker is still in early stage.
It will be released as soon as possible under the artistic open-source licence.
Currently, it's 100% owned by TCA, it is not publicly available, keep it at your own discretion</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, is is hard to develop your own platform alone, since there 
is a bunch of technical things to know before even thinking about 
starting. However, a great a number of peoples have no IT skills, 
but ideas. Coffeemaker aims to facilitate them to transform that 
into a real, working, efficient Web realization. On the side, the
reader should know that Coffeemaker is going with Paar (Platform 
as a Robot), another piece of code coming from a larger concept that 
make things "robot-ready". At this time, tough, Paar is not yet 
available for release.</p>
