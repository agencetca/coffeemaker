<h1>Coffeemaker.io</h1>

<h2>Your personal platform kit</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Coffeemaker is still in early stage.
It will be released as soon as possible under the artistic open-source licence.
Currently, it's 100% owned by TCA, it is not publicly available, keep it at your own discretion</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, is is hard to develop your own platform alone, since there 
is a bunch of technical things to know before even thinking about 
starting. However, a great a number of peoples has no IT skills, 
but ideas. Coffeemaker aims to facilitate them to transform that 
into a real, working, efficient Web realization. On a side, the
reader should know that Coffeemaker is going with Paar (Platform 
as a Robot), another piece of code coming from a larger concept that 
make things "robot-ready". At this time, tough, Paar is not yet 
available for release.</p>

<h3>Installation and Requirements</h3>

<p><s>If you own a debian based linux system, you can install <a href="http://marv.in">Marvin</a>,
a friendly robot that will propose you to start a coffeemaker project. </s></p>

<h4>Here is a basic process that 'll work :</h4>

<ul>
<li>install nginx</li>
<li>git clone the source package 
<blockquote>
  <p><code>git clone ssh://guest@yousuckless.tk:/~/coffeemaker</code></li>
<li>configure nginx to serve the source package</li>
<li>make you a coffee (because it's nice)</li>
<li>open your browser at the nginx listening port, you should see the user interface</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note : no interface at this time, just test-examples</em></p>
</blockquote></p>

<p><em>Note : You might be able to use the sources without a webserver (untested).</em></p>

<h3>Filesystem</h3>

<ul>
<li>coffeemaker.js : the core library</li>
<li>core &lt;--- deprecated soon</li>
<li>repo : the repository for sequences and actions
<ul>
<li>compoz : starting repo, given for free
<ul>
<li>actions : little functions that execute small things (should be KISS-based)</li>
<li>methods : functions aggregation</li>
<li>process : methods aggregation</li>
<li>rationales : process aggregation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>your own repo : as it sounds, could be a compoz fork</li>
</ul></li>
<li>static : static files location
<ul>
<li>images</li>
<li>lib : external libraries that can not be handle by coffeemaker
<ul>
<li>jquery (example)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>1) you load something, an action, a process, or method or whatever</p>

<p>2) coffeemaker looks on the server side and tries to get a file called "require.json" </p>

<p>3) if it get it, it parses it and downloads thing associated with</p>

<p>4) then your request is transfered to the builder ("core/system")</p>

<p>5) the builder loop on things that had been downloaded and compact them into a sequence</p>

<p><em>Note : each entry in the sequence is an order for core/system/exec to execute an action</em></p>

<p>6 ) the first action of the sequence is launched</p>

<p>7) things do what you tell them to do</p>

<h4>Make sequences</h4>

<p><em>Note : at his time the system is nor flex nor strong, so follow carefully the instructions</em></p>

<p>1) create a folder in /repo, this is YOUR repo</p>

<p>2) create file like component.js or component.json (you are free for the name)</p>

<p>3) configure the file (instructions are on next paragraphe)</p>

<ul>
<li>If it is component.JS it will be an  action</li>
<li>If it is component.JSON it could be a method, process or rationale</li>
</ul>

<p>4) load your component. They ALWAYS need a callback at the end, even empty (sorry for that)
<em>See next sections for more details on loading</em></p>

<p>5) it should work...</p>

<h4>Make an action</h4>

<p>1) Go in YOUR repo, create a file like "component.js"</p>

<p>2) Edit the file like this:</p>

<p><em>Note : an action ALWAYS receive an object as first argument, it is the "DB"</em></p>

<p><em>Note : an action ALWAYS receive a function as last argument, it called next</em></p>

<p><em>Do not forget to include DB and next as first and last arguments</em></p>

<p><em>Optional arguments go on the middle</em></p>

<p><em>You also MUST launch next() when your action is done (otherwise the whole set stops</em></p>

<p><em>It is still unclear if you always need to send the DB as a next argument... you should do it for the moment.</em></p>

<p>Make a function following this pattern</p>

<pre><code>    my function() {
        this.action1 = function(db, thing, thing2, next)  {
            //do awesome stuff
            next(db)
        };

        this.action2 = function(db, next) {
            //do awesome stuff
            next(db)
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Create a file require.json at the root of YOUR repo
Edit it like :</p>

<pre><code>    {
        require : [
            component.js 
        ]

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Launch it (see section further)</p>

<h4>Make a method</h4>

<p>1) Go in your repo, create a file like "component.json"</p>

<p><em>Note you will need an action file. You can use component.js previously created or another lib like compoz/actions/someThing</em></p>

<p>2) Edit the file like this:</p>

<p><em>Note : args1 or args2 in the example below are NOT values. They are references to the attribute of an object that travels through all the actions in the set.</em></p>

<p><em>Note : See the section "Launch a method" for more details</em></p>

<pre><code>{

    name : "name of the method",
    payload : [

        ["MyRepo/action1", "arg1, "arg2"],
        [ "Compoz/actions/someThing", "args1" ],
        [ "otherRepo/someThing" ]] 

    ]

}
</code></pre>

<p>Create a file require.json at the root of your repo</p>

<p>Edit it like :</p>

<pre><code>    {
        require : [
            component.jaons 
        ]

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Launch it (see section further)</p>

<h4>Make a process</h4>

<p>It is exactly the same as making a method but you aggregate methods</p>

<h4>Make a rationale</h4>

<p>It is exactly the same as making a method or process but you aggregate process</p>

<h4>Launch an action</h4>

<p>Go on your controller file (could be in index.html or a dedicated javascript script you import in the headers)</p>

<p>Create an empty object, like : </p>

<p><code>myObject = {};</code></p>

<p>you might put arguments into the object, like : </p>

<p><code>myObject.arg1 = 'myValue'</code>
<code>myObject.arg2 = 'myValue2'</code></p>

<p>And then you can give the object to the loader and load your action :</p>

<pre><code>load.action('myRepo/myAction', [ myObject, "arg1", "arg2"], function (a) {

    //final code
    console.log(a);

}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note : at the moment an argument array with an object as first argument is required, even empty</em></p>

<p><em>Note 2 : at the moment a callback is required, even doing nothing</em></p>

<p><em>Note 3 : at the moment the callback is OUTSIDE the argument array. Yes, it sucks a bit, the whole need of an array should be removed in next version</em></p>

<p><em>Note 4 : you receive an object in the callback, see "Concepts" and "Launch an action"</em></p>

<h4>Launch a method</h4>

<p><em>Note : Unlike "actions", "methods" don't accept arguments in the loader. If you try, you'll see that arguments are just ignored.</em></p>

<p><em>Note 2 : You NEED nevertheless to give an array with object as first argument, like in the action launching case above</em></p>

<p>It is exactly the same idea as action
    load.process('myRepo/myMethod, [ myObject ]....
No arguments are taken into account</p>

<h4>Launch a process</h4>

<p>It is exactly the same idea as method
    load.process('myRepo/myProcess, [ myObject ]....
No arguments are taken into account</p>

<h4>Launch a rationale</h4>

<p>It is exactly the same idea as method and process
    load.rationale('myRepo/myRat, [ myObject ]....
No arguments are taken into account</p>

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<p><strong>DB</strong> : The object you gave to a loader. It will travel through all the actions/methods/process/rationales in a set. You get it as unique argument on your outgoing callback. If you dont give an object the system fails (currently no dummy object is created).</p>

<p><strong>next</strong> : is the following callback that has to be executed in a set of actions. It is an internal functionnality but you need to know it if you make actions (see "Make actions" for details)</p>

<h3>API</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>window["Coffeemaker"]</strong></p>

<p><em>Side Note : load/methods,process,rationales and system/methods,process,rationales works exactly the same and should be merged asap</em></p>
