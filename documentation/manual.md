Today, is is hard to develop your own platform alone, since there 
is a bunch of technical things to know before even thinking about 
starting. However, a great a number of peoples have no IT skills, 
but ideas. Coffeemaker aims to facilitate them to transform that 
into a real, working, efficient Web realization. On the side, the
reader should know that Coffeemaker is going with Paar (Platform 
as a Robot), another piece of code coming from a larger concept that 
make things "robot-ready". At this time, tough, Paar is not yet 
available for release.

###Installation and Requirements

<s>If you own a debian based linux system, you can install [Marvin](http://marv.in),
a friendly robot that will propose you to start a coffeemaker project. </s>

####Here is a basic process that 'll work : 

- install nginx
- git clone the source package 
>    `git clone ssh://guest@yousuckless.tk:/~/coffeemaker`
- configure nginx to serve the source package
- make you a coffee (because it's nice)
- open your browser at the nginx listening port, you should see the user interface

*Note : You might be able to use the sources without a webserver (untested).*
